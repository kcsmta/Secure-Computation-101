Efficient multiparty computation toolkit, which contain implementation of various techniques including: oblivious transfer (OT), garble circuit (GC), and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). It is recommended to follow the components sequentially, as later techniques build upon earlier ones. For instance, GC and ZKP rely on OT.
