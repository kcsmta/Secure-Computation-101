## Follow this [official repo](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY).


## Installation
It is recommended to download and build the library in a partition with sufficient storage space.

### Install dependencies
The ABY library relies on several dependencies for arithmetic computation, cryptographic functions, and other utilities. Ensure that you have the following libraries installed: GMP (for arbitrary-precision arithmetic), OpenSSL (for cryptographic functions), and Boost (for various C++ utilities)

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y libgmp-dev libssl-dev libboost-all-dev
```

You can stop installing dependencies here and proceed to the next section, which is installing ABY. Thereâ€™s no need to install `Relic`, `ENCRYPTO_utils`, or `OTExtension` manually. Doing so may result in unexpected errors.

- [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic). RELIC is a modern research-oriented cryptographic meta-toolkit with emphasis on efficiency and flexibility. RELIC can be used to build efficient and usable cryptographic toolkits tailored for specific security levels and algorithmic choices.
    - Install requirement GMP (as above)
    - Download the latest version of [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic), then build, and install:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic.git
    $ cd relic
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    ```

- [ENCRYPTO_utils](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ENCRYPTO_utils).  ENCRYPTO_utils is a crypto and networking utils used for ABY and OTExtension.
    - Install requirements [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic) and Boost (as above).
    - Download [ENCRYPTO_utils](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ENCRYPTO_utils), then build, and install:
    ```
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/encryptogroup/ENCRYPTO_utils.git
    $ cd ENCRYPTO_utils
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    ```
    *Note 1: in my case, I had to manually add `#include <cstdlib>` in the header file `/src/ENCRYPTO_utils/channel.h`. Otherwise, it raised an error related to `malloc` and `free` functions.

- [OTExtension](https://github.com/encryptogroup/OTExtension). OTExtension is a C++ OT extension implementation.
    - Install requirements GMP, OpenSSL, and Boost (as above).
    - Download [OTExtension](https://github.com/encryptogroup/OTExtension), then build, and install:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/encryptogroup/OTExtension.git
    $ cd ENCRYPTO_utils
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    ```
    *Note that: according to `WeiViming`'s aswer for [this issue](https://github.com/encryptogroup/OTExtension/issues/32), we should not install `ENCRYPTO_utils` by ourselves before installing `OTExtension`.*

### Install ABY
(Move to a partition with sufficient storage space.)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY.git
$ cd ABY
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

*Note 1: in my case, I had to manually add `#include <cstdlib>` in the header file `ABY/extern/ENCRYPTO_utils/src/ENCRYPTO_utils/channel.h`. Otherwise, it raised an error related to `malloc` and `free` functions. Should we install `OTExtension` and `ENCRYPTO_utils` libraries before installing `ABY`?*

*Note 2: in my case, I had to manually comment `find_dependency(MIRACL)` in the file `/usr/local/lib/cmake/ABY/ABYConfig.cmake`. According to [this issue](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY/issues/151), the authors replaced `MIRACL` as dependency with the `RELIC` library*

After running above commands, you can see the folders `abycore`, `ENCRYPTO_utils`, `ot`, and `relic` inside the folder `/usr/local/include/`, and `libaby.a`, `libencrypto_utils.a`, `libotextention.a`, and `librelic_s.a` library in `/user/local/lib`. Once the `ABY` installed, you can use the `ABY` in your code.

## Code
### Step 1: Write CMakeLists.txt
Use the `CMakeLists.txt` file for your project (modify appropriate information if needed). In `add_executable` in the `CMakeLists.txt`, change the file you want to build.

### Step 2: Write your code
See `.cpp` files such as `millionaire.cpp`, `bit.cpp`, `bit.cpp`,... 

### Step 3: Build your code
```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

*In my case, I occur [this issue](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY/issues/197). The solution of `Country-If` works for me.*

### Step 4: Run your code
Alice (sender):
```
$ ./emp_ot_playground 0
```
Bob (receiver)
```
$ ./emp_ot_playground 1
```
