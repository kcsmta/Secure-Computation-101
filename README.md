# Study-Secure-Computation Resources
This is a beginner-friendly resource which includes various secure computation libraries. This repo aims to help you understand and implement secure computation techniques such as homomorphic encryption (HE), oblivious trasfer (OT), garble circuit (GC), arithmetic secret sharing (e.g., Beaver), boolean secret sharing (e.g.,GMW), function secret sharing (FSS), zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).
